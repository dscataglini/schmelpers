= Schmelpers

This is a collection of smart helpers to make development easy and effective

== Install

  gem install schmelpers

== Usage

Sh.include takes the type of include followed by the local path to the file
and optional remote path (cdn)
When there is no internet connection it will use the local path. 
When there is an internet connection it will use the cdn url.
This helps a lot when developing and internet connection is not reliable.

  Sh.include(:js, local_path [, cdn_url])
  Sh.include(:css, local_path [, cdn_url])
  # => When internet connection is not present it will use the local 

  Sh.include(:async, local_path [, cdn_url])
  # => Same as above but it includes the javascript(s) asyncronously
